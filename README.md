## About The Project
This project predicts future price movements through a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is used to generate a quantitative view on future stock performances. These forward projections are then fed into the Black-Litterman algorithm, which traditionally relied on subjective portfolio manager views for portfolio allocation
